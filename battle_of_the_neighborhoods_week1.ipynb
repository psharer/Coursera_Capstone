    "Assume an entertainment company is choosing a location for a night club in New York City.  This report will suggest the top three neighborhoods for the night club by analyzing data obtained using the Four Square API and data for New York City's neighborhoods. In addition, an appropriate genre of music will be recommended from the following: EDM (Electronic Dance Music), Trap, Hip Hop, Trance, or House based on the neighborhood's proximity to other clubs."

    "Said entertainment company wants to choose an optimal location for their night club which will attract a lot of patrons. Locating the club in a popular, trendy area of the city is important. Neighborhoods with other clubs within walking distance are a good bet for oftentimes club patrons will hop from club to club, especially, if there are other genres of music close by. Thus, it will be important to locate the club in an area which isn't already saturated by clubs of the same genre of music. That is, we want to avoid placing an EDM club in an area already saturated by other EDM clubs. One club of the same type might be okay for you will have curious club goers that like EDM music want to try a different venue and they are already nearby but if there are already two or three EDM clubs within walking distance or a five minute cab/uber ride that neighborhood should be avoided.
